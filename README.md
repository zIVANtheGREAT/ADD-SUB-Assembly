This source code goes through the addition, subtraction, increment and decrement instructions
in assembly as well as some overflow and underflow flags. this is done in visual studios. 
using the debug, we can see the registers updating as you step through the code as well as the flags being updated. 
there's a link in the cource code that references where the code came from as well as a walkthrough by CodingQuest.
